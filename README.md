# HW3 - React 312 App with Supabase

In the previous Homework, you worked on creating a react app with local state maintained with useState prop. For this Homework, you will start with the 
react app which uses local state and then add code to make it work with a backend hosted on supabase.

The skeleton code contains a fully functional code with local state maintained in react. 

## Getting Started 

Open the terminal window and type in `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file and will create a folder `node_modules` where all these dependencies will be installed. `npm run dev` will run a local development server and open a web browser window for you that's pointed at your application.

## Supabase code
The supabase code can be found [here](https://github.com/GiuseppeCalderonio/homework3/tree/master/src/database_starter), to run the project is necessary to run these queries in a supabase project.

## .env file
For security reasons, the .env file is not reported here, but the values that should be present to let the code work are:
1. VITE_APP_SUPABASE_URL="the url"
2. VITE_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="the key"
